Now, let's handle the Shopping Cart functionality.
Requirements:
Add to Cart Logic: In script.js, when a user clicks "Add to Cart" on a product, save that item to localStorage (or Firestore if user is logged in, but use localStorage for now for simplicity). Update the cart badge count in the header immediately.
Separate Cart Page: Create a new file named cart.html.
Do NOT use a modal or popup for the cart. It must be a dedicated page.
Cart Page Features:
List all selected items with their image, name, price, and quantity adjuster (+ / -).
Show a summary section: Subtotal, Tax, and Total Price.
A "Checkout" button.
A button to "Clear Cart".
Ensure the Dark Mode toggle works on this page as well.

​I need an Admin Panel to manage my store inventory.
​Create admin.html:
​Design a clean, responsive form using Tailwind CSS (consistent with the main site style).
​Form Fields:
​Product Name (Text)
​Category (Dropdown Select). Options must be: Nuts, Spices, Food Products, Cosmetics, Baby Diapers, Drinks.
​Price (Number)
​Description (Text Area)
​Product Image (File Input)
​Add a large "Add Product" button.
​Add a status container to show messages (e.g., "Uploading image...", "Product saved successfully").
​JavaScript Logic (in script.js or a new admin.js):
​Initialize Firebase/Firestore (if not already done).
​Create a function to handle the form submission.
​Step A (Image Upload): When submitted, first take the image file and upload it to ImgBB API using a POST request.
​Note for AI: Create a constant IMGBB_API_KEY at the top of the file (I will paste my key there).
​Step B (Save to Database): Once ImgBB returns the image URL (data.display_url), take that URL along with the other form data (Name, Price, Category) and add a new document to the Firestore collection named 'products'.
​UX: Show a loading spinner or text while uploading. Clear the form after success.
​Security/Navigation:
​Add a link in the footer of index.html (or a hidden shortcut) to go to admin.html easily.
